============= what it does ====================
The code is doing a simulation for Calorimeter Scifi

=============how to compile =====================
you need to 
1. have a standard build of geant4 with openGL and setup its environment. (I used version 4.9.3.p02 with instruction http://geant4.slac.stanford.edu/installation/)
2. have compat-gcc-*-c++* package installed (I use compat-gcc-34-c++-3.4.6-20.fc14.x86_64 on my fedora 14 x64 system) and make sure the include directory in GNUmakefile is correct
3. then you can type "make", binary will be in bin/*

============== how to run =========================
1. interactive mode, 
just run "CaloSim", it will use mac/vis.mac to create openGL graphic windows

2. batch mode
eg. "CaloSim mac/100_2GeV.mac out.root"

3. options
besides standard geant4 options, there are some addtional option control particle gun. 
use "ls /Gun" after start interactive mode to see them

4. turn field on/off
  in CaloSimDetectorConstruction.cc, comment/uncomment line 
  "fpMagField->SetMagFieldValue(2*tesla);"

5. change radiation material
   in CaloSimDetectorConstruction.cc, modify the line
   "G4LogicalVolume* logicCaloBlock = new G4LogicalVolume(solidCaloBlock,Tungsten,"CaloBlockLV");"

============== script ==============================
in script directory, find some script used to view resulting root files


============== doc ================================
CaloSim.pdf from original authur


============== old stuff ===========================
we may dig out useful stuff from old mac, old scripts, old src.

============== Update List ===========================

03/21/2011 Jin Huang <jinhuang@jlab.org>
	Added support for
    * Set field from mac script: ex. mac/TestFile.mac
    * Added hadron simulation, beam of pion, kaon from mac script: ex. mac/TestFile.mac
    * Added option for preshower - shower confirguration: switch configurations at src/CaloSimDetectorConstruction.C::Construct()
    * Script tools to convert GEMC phase space to input file and load via mac scripts: high level script at script/GEMC2CaloSimScript.C
